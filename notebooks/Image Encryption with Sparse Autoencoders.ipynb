        "Network-based machine learning algorithms are extremely powerful. Especially in the computer vision field, various different methods are continually being developed to enhance computer capabilities to classify and contextualize objects in our world. One key strength of network-based algorithms is its ability to approximate non-linear behaviors. These patterns are learned by feeding the model massive amounts of training data. The more training (and testing) data available, the better the chance the model has at seeing all the different nuances in the underlying distribution of whateever activity it is being applied to.\n",

In the event of a data breach or some adversarial attack to the host of such images, thousands or millions of individuals faces and other data tied to them can circulate without their control. Nonetheless, for innovation to continually grow and achieve state of the art performance, researchers still require such data to be available. \n",

        "There are current methods of encryption of such images so that humans cannot understand images but the network model can still be trained on these encrypted images. This is a growing feel in recent years. Early strategies included shuffling pixels around, directly encrypting images, or applying Gaussian or Poisson noise to the image. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that these defenses can be overcome with adversarial neural networks. Thus, the ideal solution would successfully conceal these images from adversaries, while allowing trustworthy parties (e.g. users who own the pictures with their faces) to reconstruct them. Because end-users need an easy way to obtain their hidden images, the ideal solution must also be compact enough so that speed and efficiency are unaffected. For instance, federal level databases storing citizenship information and faces may need to share specific images of individuals with different parties. The solution we propose is to introduce a method of sharing only encrypted, codified versions of images rather than images directly. Thus, only parties with the corresponding key can access and reconstruct the image appropriately. "

        "Image recognition has always been a core challenge for computer vision since the field's inception. Among the various breakthroughs, Yann LeCun's LeNet holds the honor of pioneering the first feasible convolutional neural networks. Though LeNet's design was simplistic, its clever use of 5 layers composed of 5x5 convolutions and 2x2 maxpooling paved the way for machine digit recognition. Indeed, the combination of two dimensional convolutions and maxpooling served as the main inspiration for the encoder that was trained in this study.\n",

Sohrab Ferdowsi et al.'s research from 2020 was instrumental for showcasing one of the first realizable attempts at compressing and searching visual data in large-scale systems. In his paper \"Learning to compress and search visual data in large-scale systems\", Ferdowsi et al. proposed a novel, practical framework design for securely sharing images. Ferdowsi's findings not only demonstrate that compactness is necessary at scale, but also representations can be stored and shared publicly without compromising on privacy protection. Although the inception of the idea was of our own, the contributions made by Ferdowsi et al. 2020 provided a strong foundation for our model. \n",

In order to do so, Ferdowsi et al proposed a unique top-k activation function. Effectively, in between the encoder and decoder stages, the support of the latent representation vector space is collected. This is done so to avoid large intermediary matrices with intractable complexities and extremely high risks of overfitting. By breaking up the convolutional features and passing them to a much smaller fully-connected linear layer, the final network can learn multiple features of each image in a non-strenuous manner.\n",

        "In class, we discussed the power of autoencoders and their ability to denoise images. We also briefly touched on the topic of diffusion models and introduced the idea of injecting noise into the latent space of autoencoders to enhance its denoising capability while making the training procedure more computationally efficient. This inspired us to explore latent representations of images for encryption techniques. Our idea is to build an autoencoder with stacked linear layers such that multiple codecs of an image would be generated. The network would be trained in a way to allow control over reconstruction fidelity so that security can be regulated. The technique of implementing such a training procedure was motivated by Ferdowsi et al. 2020. Each of these codes would be sparsified, latent vectors that when passed to the trained decoder can be reconstructed appropriately if the correct key is provided. The index of the correct code would act as the reconstruction key, which would then be given to the corresponding trustworthy party. Note that this key can be much more easily encrypted than an entire image. In order to formulate a compact solution, the model's training heavily relied on sparsity. Specifically, sparsity was injected into the latent representations by applying a special activation function that collected the top-k nonzero values. The added sparsity allowed control over the resolution of the reconstructed images. Otherwise, if a given code wants to be private, locally sampled noise would be applied to inject noise to prevent image reconstruction, since the decoder was trained on sparsity but not to handle noise. \n",

We effectively utilized VGG-16 as the encoder and replicated it on the decoder end.

        "In the next 2 iterations of training, the high level architecture from Ferdowsi et al. 2020 (Reference 4) was implemented. For the second training iteration, we adjusted the dimensions of the layers and shapes of the filters in the downsampling and upsampling blocks, making them uniformly `(3x3)` as VGG-16 had implemented it. Initially, the implementation in Ferdowsi et al. 2020 had `[40,40,40,40,40,10]`. However, in our implementation we modeled our filter sizes off of VGG-16 and changed them to `[64,128,256,512,12]`, with the last dimension for bottlenecking and to align with the number of groups in the stacked linear layers. Additionally, we maintained uniform strides whereas the original implementation had alternating scaling factors between 1 and 2. Lastly, in our final training iteration, we adopted the same kernel sizes as implemented in Ferdowsi et al. 2020. However, we still reduced the number of blocks from 6 to 5 in both the encoder and decoder. The principle change in iteration 3 was that we inspected the architecture of the decoder and noticed that it was not symmetrical to the encoder. We hypothesized that for the performance to be optimal and proposed idea to be practical, we would want a decoder that matches the reflection of the encoder. Thus, we injected an additional convolutional layer in the upsampling blocks and adopted the forward pass. See a figure of an example of the downsampling block, upsampling block, and stacked linear layers, respectively below. Figures taken from Reference 4."

The results are shown in the following figure. For the first result, we simply enumerated samples in the test dataloader. We provide results for reconstructing with same sparsity level as during training (k=128) and half (k=64).

All other codecs would have some type of sampled noise applied to obscure the reconstruction process. In this test, we leveraged a pre-built module for estimating the distirbution of pixel values to draw noise from.  These results demonstrate our model's reconstruction of encrypted codes of images.

PSNR is a measurement that inspects the quality of image compression with respect to the maximum possible power available. State of the art results generally range from 30-50 decibels (it is measured on the logarithmic scale). SSIM measures the similarity between images by inspecting the distribution of values for each pixel and thus ranges from 0-1. The metrics aligned with our visual inspection. Directionally, the quality of reconstruction diminishes on both indices as less information is provided. For both scenarios of obscured code and adversarial attack, the reconstruction quality significantly declined. The average PSNR and SSIM for test data are summarized in the following table."

Some learnings taken away were to train for more time and epochs as well as more data. Given the size of the model and number of parameters, it requires more variance in the input dataset to be able to learn and generalize well. Additionally, we would not have leveraged VGG-16 filter sizes and dimensions anymore. The VGG-16 architecture was designed for a massive classification activity of identifying up to 1000 classes. It is generally claimed that there are 40 features to learn for human face reconstruction.

In order to improve this metric, further experiments could be done with the model's architecture. For example, instead of relying on a modified version of VGG16, perhaps the model could do better with some repurposed parts from VGG16's sibling, AlexNet. As AlexNet consists of only 8 layers, our model could be further simplified with even fewer parameters. Because our study was often hindered by computational limits with Google Colab's GPU, a less complex model could potentially have an easier time training on more samples from the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset. In turn, this could bolster our results and PSNR scores."
