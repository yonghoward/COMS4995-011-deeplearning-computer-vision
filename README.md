# Image Encoders with Sparse Autoencoders
## COMS 4995 Deep Learning for Computer Vision
This repository hosts files associated with the capstone project for this graduate course. It proposes a novel encryption mechanism for image data. The proposed encryption tactic embeds a key into the latent representation of the image and trains the autoencoder to only reconstruct the image with the correct matching key.
